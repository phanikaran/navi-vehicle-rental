ADD_VEHICLE, ADD_BRANCH - act as ADD only, and not UPDATE

Vehicle class is a concrete class for all vehicle types, since all of them share the same properties and methods
    If vehicle types start differing, we can create separate Car, Bike etc classes extending Vehicle

Vehicle types are stored as String and not Enum, since we do not know the exhaustive list of ALL vehicle types yet
    If ALL vehicle types are known, we could change the type of vehicleType from String to Enum
